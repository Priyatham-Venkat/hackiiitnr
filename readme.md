ForMyCity : A website for an organisation which organises social welfare events in a city, with active participation from the people of the city, who wish to volunteer for the activities. Users can also help physically and monetarily. All the activities are co-ordinated through the website transparently.

	 The website provides an online platform for adding or joining new events throughout the city.
