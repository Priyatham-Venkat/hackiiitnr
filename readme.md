ForMyCity

	 A website for an organisation which organises social welfare events in a city, with active participation from the people of the city, who wish to volunteer for the activities. Users can also help physically and monetarily. All the activities are co-ordinated through the website transparently.

	 The website provides an online platform for adding or joining new events throughout the city. Most of the times, people are unaware of the activities that are going on, because of some lower priority events, which wont be addvertised and hence the introdution og ForMyCity, the events are only shown in their city and hence by that the users can Join the event.
